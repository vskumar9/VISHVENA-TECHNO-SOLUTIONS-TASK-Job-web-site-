Python has a framework called Django which is used for creating UIs and APIs. We want you to create some APIs using Django. In Django there is a feature called migrations. This feature enables you to generate models from Database tables. Please use Python, MySQL and complete the following steps. CRUD means Create, Read, Update, Delete. So when we say CRUD APIs, it means you should creates APIs to do the above operations on a given database model.

2. Create a table called Admin Users which has fields viz. id, name, email. Create APIs for CRUD
3. Create a table called Job with the fields id, job_title, job_description. Create APIs for CRUD
